Numerical Methods in Julia, for a scientific computing of diffeqs class

This is just a repo with some numerical methods for integrating differential equations that I produce for a class. 
One big thing studied in this class is how different methods hold up performance for different types of diff eqs.
My first test in this repo is what works best for stiff diff eqs: explicit euler, implicit euler, or rk4 and to gain intuition as to why.
